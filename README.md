Hi, I'm Jeff.  I work in that special place where games, narrative, and AI intersect.  I made the Elm Narrative Engine for making non-linear narrative story games and now I'm learning Python and AI to take it to next level. I'm interested in working with others in this space! https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffschomay/
