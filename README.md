Hi, I'm Jeff. I've made a few [games](https://enegames.itch.io/) and a [narrative game engine](https://enegames.itch.io/elm-narrative-engine). I've written a good amount about my journey on [making games with AI](https://blog.jeffschomay.com/). I've [spoken](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuygUufmilnpbF37SmNVFyl32sVCoyDy0&feature=shared) at a few conferences too. Professionally I'm working deep with generative AI in challenging domains. I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/discovery-see-all?usecase=PEOPLE_FOLLOWS&followMember=jeffschomay) and [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/jschomay) if you want to collaborate.
